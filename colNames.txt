
Sometimes we need to find out what are the tables having this specific column. e.g. in CS what are the tables having address_id column. You can use below query for this:

 

SELECT t.name AS table_name,

SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,

c.name AS column_name

FROM sys..tables AS t

INNER JOIN sys.columns c ON t.OBJECT_ID = c.OBJECT_ID

WHERE c.name LIKE '%address_id%'

ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;
